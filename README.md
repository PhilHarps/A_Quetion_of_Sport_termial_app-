## Coder Academy Boot Camp September 2019

# A Question Of Sport Quiz

## Definition:
  I decided on creating a multiple choice sports quiz incorporating the coding skills I have obtained during the first few weeks of Coder Academy.
## Aim

The aim of the game is to get as many questions correct. Each question has four options for answers. If you don't know have a guess!




# Files
I decided to split the program up into three files:
- aqos_main.rb:
 The main program that runs the welcome page and 					    prompts the user to start the game.
 - aqos_qanda.rb:
 This file has the qanda class and a method to loop through the questions, keeps your score and tells the score at the end of the game.
 - aqos_uk_quiz.rb:
 This file has the questions and answers in it with an array of hashes to call from.

## Gems
I used the following gems in this program

- colorize
[https://rubygems.org/gems/colorize/versions/0.8.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/colorize/versions/0.8.1)
- artii
[https://rubygems.org/gems/artii/versions/2.1.2](https://rubygems.org/gems/artii/versions/2.1.2)


### Loading the app:
Open up terminal and navigate to the directory that contains the terminal app files and type aqos_main.rb. This will open the main page where you can select to start the game by pressing "y" or "n" to exit the game. Once the game starts you answer the question by selecting the letter next what you think the answer is e.g. "a", "b', "c" and "d". At the end of the game it will tell you your total correct.
